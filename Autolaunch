This will launch the game for me automatically when I run the script the filepath is specific to my machine, but can be modified for others.

It does launch it the game will close then reopen it and load all the way through havent figured out why it does this but it still works
put in a sleep timer so that it doesnt give the can not find Brawlhalla error when the script is looking for brawlhalla window.
hopefully you can get it to a point where it autofills the directory
SetWorkingDir, F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Brawlhalla
Run, Brawlhalla
Sleep,15000
